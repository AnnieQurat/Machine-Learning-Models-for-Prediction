# Machine-Learning-Models-for-Prediction

## Short description

### What's the problem?

Using the dataset containing sales prices of cars, eprocess and prepare the data to apply the machine learning knowledge studied in Book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow. This will include creating, analysing and generating predictions with regression models.

Also, using the previous data preparation, we'll predict car prices using several Machine Learning Algorithms:

1) KNN Regressor, 
2) Decision Tree Regressor,
3) Ensemble Bagging Regressor,
4) Random Forest Regressor.
